# Pipelined-MIPS32-Processor-Implementation
 Designed and implemented a 5-stage pipelined MIPS32 processor using Verilog, incorporating Instruction
 Fetch (IF), Instruction Decode (ID), Execute (EX), Memory (MEM), and Write-Back (WB) stages.
 Optimized pipeline balancing and critical path delays to improve MIPS32 processor efficiency by 30%,
 increasing clock frequency, reducing stalls, and minimizing bottlenecks.
